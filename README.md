***Technologies Used:***

  * In this project, I recreated a website that retrieves data from New York Times website so we can display it on our own by using API keys, JSONP, and ajax
  * Used node.js and gulp to conveniently compile my SCSS files 
  into css which conveniently helped me code more efficiently with a variety of extra functions it provides such as 
  browsersync and eslint. 
  * Incorporated responsive design, so it is build from mobile first, with tablet and desktop widths

***Personal Learnings:***

  This project was very entertaining to do, it was amazing to think we can already retrieve data and sort the ones I
  want from a company as big as New York Times. Gulp also made compiling and coding so much more convenient because 
  it informs you of the errors that are usually made. The introduction of the scss format is also very useful, it 
  provides an easier way to style my code and it is also very convenient because of the variables, mixins, and global 
  values which helps a lot to make my code more modular. The tools we used in the project is definitely a valuable asset
  in the future to increase productivity and efficiency, and the content of it is great too.
